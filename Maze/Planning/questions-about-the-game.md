SUBJECT: Questions about the game

While we are in the process of understanding the requirements, we have a couple 
questions that we would like you to answer to help us with clarification. 

What is a fake gem in the context of playing this game? Are there duplicate gems on the board or are 
"fake" gems just gems that look similar to each other?

What is the end result of the game when all players do not move? Who would be the winner?

What happens to the player on a tile that is being removed from the board?
