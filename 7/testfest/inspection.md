#### Git Log Inspection


- [10/10] for `git add remote` as instructed by the "new repo" instructions of GH Enterprise; does the history predate 3 Nov 2022?

- [60/60] for not copying code from the original repo
  
  
#### Tech Debt Downpayment

- [20/20] for a helpful and accurate self eval

- [10/10] for unique and specific todo and completed items

- [50/50] for good commit messages that aid in understanding the change and appreciating the improvement to the code.

#### Required Revision

You admit you did not do anything the self eval asks for.

- [24/40]

#### Design

 - [5/5] for ranking all three tasks with one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 - [5/5] for using complete sentences for each explanation
 - [0/5] for delivering acceptable explanations
   - Very unconvincing answer for #3. Why is it _only_ a change to the player interface? You don't actually explain your rationale, only a proposed solution._
