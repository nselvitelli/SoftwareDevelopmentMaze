#### Git Log Inspection


- [0/10] for `git add remote` as instructed by the "new repo" instructions of GH Enterprise; does the history predate 3 Nov 2022?

- [60/60] for not copying code from the original repo

Returning `null` instead of an optional three times in the codebase? Really? In fact you _added_ more `return null`s! Why? The other codebase used `Optional<X>` for a reason.

  
#### Tech Debt Downpayment

- [20/20] for a helpful and accurate self eval

- [10/10] for unique and specific todo and completed items

- [0/50] for good commit messages that aid in understanding the change and appreciating the improvement to the code.
  - No commits linked in `todo.md`
  
> Step 2 Work through this todo list. As you complete an item, move it from the todo list to a separate section, entitled “Completed.” Add the git commits plus the commit messages that fix the issue.
> 
> The TAs will cross-check that at the end all git commits are accounted for.


#### Required Revision

- [10/10] for a unit test that validates the implementation of the relaxation (board is not 7 x 7)
- [0/10] fora unit test that validates the implementation of the relaxation (board is not square)
- [6/10] for a unit test that validates that a board is suitable for the given number of players 
  - You admit you didn't do this
- [6/10] for a unit test that rejects a board as too small for the given number of players 
  - You admit you didn't do this


#### Design

 - [5/5] for ranking all three tasks with one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 - [5/5] for using complete sentences for each explanation
 - [5/5] for delivering acceptable explanations
   - The last one is iffy, I don't think its clear to the reader why we can conclude that it won't be considerably hard.
